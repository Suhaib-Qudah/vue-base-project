#  Project - Types Directory

## Overview

the `types` directory of the Himam project! This directory is dedicated to housing TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) that declare the module structures used throughout the project. These declaration files play a crucial role in providing type information for external modules and ensuring robust type checking within the project.

## Contents

The `types` directory contains a set of TypeScript declaration files, each corresponding to a specific module or group of related modules within the Himam project. These declaration files serve as documentation for the expected types, interfaces, and structures of the associated modules, facilitating seamless integration and collaboration across the codebase.

## Purpose

### 1. **Type Safety:**

The primary purpose of the `types` directory is to enforce type safety within the Himam project. By providing explicit type information for modules, developers can catch type-related errors early in the development process, leading to more robust and maintainable code.

### 2. **Documentation:**

The TypeScript declaration files serve as a form of documentation, making it easier for developers to understand the expected interfaces and structures of the modules they interact with. This promotes code readability and accelerates the onboarding process for new contributors.

### 3. **External Module Integration:**

The `.d.ts` files in this directory also play a crucial role in defining the public interfaces of the Himam project for external modules and libraries. This ensures a consistent and well-defined API for users integrating with or extending the project.

**Happy coding!**
